Using median and untransformed variance estimates for log-normal outcome data, this work aims to explain how to determine the sample size for a two-group comparison of interest.
 It is anticipated that outcome data will follow a log-normal distribution, and a sample size calculation method for a

 When the change of interest is defined as a difference in median values on the untransformed scale, a two-sample t-test that compares log-transformed outcome data is illustrated.  The method is applied to a real-world neurosurgery case and is compared with a non-parametric alternative (the Mann-Whitney U test) in a number of scenarios using a simulation exercise.
